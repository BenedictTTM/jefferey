        excerpt: "Networking is more than exchanging business cards. Learn how authentic relationships, shared values, and mutual support can accelerate your entrepreneurial journey and create lasting impact.",
        content: `
            <p>Networking is often viewed as a transactional activity—exchanging business cards and seeking favors. But true networking is about building meaningful relationships based on shared values and mutual support. My journey with Forbes BLK has taught me the power of community in the entrepreneurial journey.</p>
            
            <h3>Authenticity Matters</h3>
            <p>People connect with people, not just professional titles. Be authentic in your interactions. Share your story, your struggles, and your triumphs. Vulnerability fosters genuine connections.</p>
            
            <h3>Give Before You Receive</h3>
            <p>The best networkers are givers. Look for ways to add value to others—whether it's making an introduction, sharing knowledge, or offering support. When you give without expectation, you create a reservoir of goodwill that often comes back to you in unexpected ways.</p>
            
            <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
            <p>A strong network is a diverse network. Seek out connections with people from different backgrounds, industries, and perspectives. Diversity fuels innovation and opens up new possibilities.</p>
            
            <p>Building meaningful networks takes time and effort, but the rewards are immeasurable. Through communities like Forbes BLK, I've found mentors, partners, and friends who have enriched my life and accelerated my career.</p>
